<h2 id="doom-1993-the-grandfather-of-firstperson-shooters">DOOM 1993: The Grandfather of First-Person Shooters</h2>
<p>Though there were earlier FPS games like <em>Wolfenstein</em> and <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>, <em>DOOM</em> (1993) is often regarded as the <strong>&quot;Grandfather of First-Person Shooters&quot;</strong>. While games like <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em> laid the groundwork for the genre, <em>DOOM</em> truly revolutionized FPS gaming. This is mainly because <em>DOOM</em> managed to <strong>simulate 3D environments</strong>, giving players a sense of depth and immersion, something <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em> couldn't do with its flat, 2D look.</p>
<h3 id="binary-space-partitioning-bsp">Binary Space Partitioning (BSP)</h3>
<p>The secret behind <em>DOOM</em>'s ability to simulate a 3D effect was the use of <strong>Binary Space Partitioning (BSP)</strong>. In the early 90s, true 3D rendering would have been too computationally expensive for personal computers. BSP allowed <em>DOOM</em> to divide the game's space into smaller sections, rendering environments faster without losing quality. This technique also enabled dynamic lighting, a feature never seen before at this scale. Objects could now have brightness based on their distance from the player, which brought the game to life.</p>
<h3 id="binary-space-partitioning-bsp">2D Sprites Rendered as 3D: Billboarding and Dynamic Lighting</h3>
<p>One of the most impressive techniques used in <em>DOOM</em> was <strong>Billboarding</strong>, where 2D images (sprites) were dynamically resized based on how far they were from the player. This gave the illusion of 3D objects. Furthermore, the sprites always faced the camera to prevent the player from realizing that they were merely 2D images.</p>
<p>Combined with <strong>dynamic lighting</strong>, the effect was even more convincing. Objects closer to the player appeared brighter and more detailed, while those further away faded, mimicking real-world lighting and contributing to the feeling of depth and space.</p>
<h3 id="binary-space-partitioning-bsp">Game Engine vs. Game Logic: A Groundbreaking Approach</h3>
<p>Before <em>DOOM</em>, most games were built with the <strong>game engine</strong> and <strong>game logic</strong> tightly intertwined. <em>DOOM</em>, however, modularized this by separating the two. The game engine handled all the tech aspects, like rendering graphics, processing inputs, and detecting collisions. Meanwhile, the <strong>game data</strong> (such as textures, sounds, and level layouts) was stored in <strong>WAD files</strong> (short for &quot;Where’s All the Data&quot;).</p>
<p>This separation allowed developers to port <em>DOOM</em> to different platforms easily. Only the game engine needed modification, while the game data remained the same, making <em>DOOM</em> incredibly versatile.</p>
<h3 id="binary-space-partitioning-bsp">User-Created Maps: Empowering the Community</h3>
<p>In another first for the industry, <em>DOOM</em> allowed players to create their own maps and share them with others. The game’s support for <strong>user-made levels</strong> through WAD files meant that players could create entirely new experiences within the game. This not only kept the community engaged but also inspired the creation of a whole genre of &quot;DOOM-clones&quot; as developers borrowed ideas from the game.</p>
<h3 id="binary-space-partitioning-bsp">Deathmatch and LAN Gaming: The Birth of Competitive Multiplayer</h3>
<p>One of <em>DOOM</em>'s most significant contributions to gaming culture was the introduction of <strong>Deathmatch</strong>, where players would compete to be the last one standing. This was also one of the earliest implementations of <strong>LAN multiplayer</strong>, allowing players to connect their computers via local area networks, instead of relying on a single console or hardware setup. This laid the foundation for competitive multiplayer games as we know them today.</p>
<h3 id="binary-space-partitioning-bsp">Open Source Code: A Legacy That Endured</h3>
<p>In 1997, id Software made the <em>DOOM</em> source code open-source. This decision encouraged programmers to explore the game's inner workings and create their own versions or modifications of the game. By the early 2000s, <em>DOOM</em> clones were abundant, and this eventually led to the term <strong>First-Person Shooter (FPS)</strong> being coined to describe the genre.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="doom-1993-the-grandfather-of-firstperson-shooters">DOOM 2016: The Reboot</h2>
<p>When <em>DOOM</em> returned in 2016, it was clear that while the technology and visuals had evolved, the heart and soul of the series remained unchanged. The development team knew that <em>DOOM</em> was not just about having cutting-edge graphics—it was about maintaining the core elements that made the game stand out in the first place.</p>
<h3 id="binary-space-partitioning-bsp">Embracing Modern Technology</h3>
<p>By 2016, personal computers had far more processing power than they did in the early 90s, allowing for <strong>true 3D rendering</strong>. <em>DOOM 2016</em> used fully-rendered 3D models for enemies and environments, improving upon the pixelated look of the original. The art style also evolved, offering much more intricate and detailed visuals, allowing the game world to feel larger and more immersive than ever before.</p>
<h3 id="binary-space-partitioning-bsp">Doomguy: From Marine to Unstoppable Force</h3>
<p>A major transformation took place with the character of <strong>Doomguy</strong>. In 1993, Doomguy was just an ordinary marine, unsure of what he was up against, but determined to survive. By 2016, Doomguy had become a legendary, <strong>unstoppable force of nature</strong>. The events that occurred between 1993 and 2016 were explored in the story, where Doomguy was transformed into a nearly indestructible being after receiving the power of the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>In the timeline between the two games, Doomguy was trapped in a tomb-like sarcophagus after receiving immense power, infused with the strength of the Dark Lord. When awakened by the UAC on Mars, the demons screamed—not in fear, but because Doomguy's return meant the end for them.</p>
<h3 id="binary-space-partitioning-bsp">Fast-Paced Action with a Modern Twist</h3>
<p><em>DOOM 2016</em> stuck to its roots with <strong>fast-paced, frenetic action</strong>. Unlike many modern FPS games at the time that focused on slow, methodical gameplay, <em>DOOM</em> kept the momentum high, forcing players to stay alert at all times. Regenerating health became a thing of the past, and instead, the player needed to constantly stay on the offensive, hunting down health packs, power-ups, and glory kills.</p>
<p>This focus on action made <em>DOOM 2016</em> a visceral and intense experience. The <strong>glory kill</strong> mechanic, where players could finish off enemies in brutal and creative ways, added even more intensity to the game.</p>
<h3 id="binary-space-partitioning-bsp">Music: Metal That Matches the Speed</h3>
<p>A major component of <em>DOOM</em>'s identity is its music. The 1993 soundtrack was fast, urgent, and filled with metal riffs that kept players on the edge of their seat. <em>DOOM 2016</em> honored that legacy by bringing in a <strong>heavier, modern metal soundtrack</strong>, but with the same spirit of speed and energy. Classic tracks like &quot;At Doom's Gate&quot; were remade with slower, more powerful riffs that perfectly matched the pace of the new game.</p>
<h3 id="binary-space-partitioning-bsp">Respecting the Past, Innovating for the Future</h3>
<p><em>DOOM 2016</em> found a delicate balance between honoring its past and moving the series forward. It respected the franchise's roots by keeping the fast-paced, bloody combat and adding more modern mechanics. At the same time, it introduced a new look and feel that appealed to both old and new fans alike. It wasn’t just another <em>Call of Duty</em> clone—it was <strong>DOOM</strong>, reinvented.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="doom-1993-the-grandfather-of-firstperson-shooters">The Legacy of DOOM</h2>
<p><em>DOOM</em> has always been about pushing the limits of gaming technology while maintaining its signature style. From its 1993 debut, which introduced revolutionary game design concepts like BSP and modular game engines, to its 2016 reboot, which brought the franchise into the modern age with 3D rendering and new gameplay mechanics, <em>DOOM</em> remains one of the most influential games in the history of the FPS genre.</p>
<h3 id="binary-space-partitioning-bsp">Trivia</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Banned in Germany</strong>: Due to its extreme violence, <em>DOOM</em> was temporarily banned in Germany. However, id Software won the case by arguing that the violence in the game was directed at demons, not humans, which did not violate German law.</li>
<li><strong>Multiplayer and Deathmatch</strong>: <em>DOOM</em> was one of the earliest games to implement LAN multiplayer and deathmatch, laying the groundwork for modern competitive gaming.</li>
<li><strong>Open Source Code</strong>: In 1997, id Software made the <em>DOOM</em> source code open-source, encouraging developers to create their own versions, mods, and games. This contributed to the explosion of FPS games in the 2000s.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="doom-1993-the-grandfather-of-firstperson-shooters">Conclusion: A Legacy of Reinvention</h2>
<p>One of the most remarkable things about <em>DOOM</em> is its ability to reinvent itself. With each release, <em>DOOM</em> stays true to its roots while embracing the latest technology and gaming trends. Whether it’s 1993 or 2016, <em>DOOM</em> has always delivered fast-paced action, intense combat, and a sense of power that makes players feel unstoppable. And as long as <em>DOOM</em> continues to innovate and stay true to its core, it will remain a foundational pillar of the first-person shooter genre for generations to come.</p>
